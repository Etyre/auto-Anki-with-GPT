// Eli's wishlist

// 1. ‚úÖ Function that writes some children 
// 2. ‚úÖ Function that grabs the data in the parent block.
// 3. ‚úÖ Hot key
// 4. ‚úÖ GPT API

// We now having a working MVP! WOOO! üéâ

// New Wishlist 

// 0. Continue tinkering with the prompt. See if I can get it to produce cloze deletions.
// 1. Make a non-janky parser function, using OpenAI functions.
// 2. Try a different "loading..." sign that, has the loading in the first child of the target block, instead of the target block itself.


// Function that updates a block string and adds some children, with helper functions.

const standardPrompt = `I‚Äôm making flashcards to review material that I‚Äôm reading. I‚Äôm going to give you a paragraph of text. Please read this text, extract the important ideas and interesting facts, and make flash cards for one.

All of the flashcards should be formatted as bullets, with the answer in a nested bullet below the question. Every question should have the tag ‚Äú#ankify‚Äù at the end.

Here are some example flashcards:

* What percentage of American women were working in offices in 1900? #ankify
   * About 20%

* How was it regarded if a woman was working in an office in 1900? #ankify
   * It was lamented as an unfortunate result of financial stress, and slightly shameful to her father.

* Why was it lamentable for a woman to be working in an office in 1900? #ankify
   * Because this would subject them to temptations of being seduced.


Alternatively, cards can be a single bullet point with a ‚Äúcloze‚Äù. A ‚Äúcloze‚Äù covers/hides the most important part of the sentence, and then is revealed to show the answer. The format for a cloze is to enclose the text to be hidden in curly brackets. Each cloze should start with the number ‚Äú1‚Äù, and a colon. There can be multiple clozes in a sentence. The bullet point should still have the ‚Äú#ankify‚Äù tag.

Some examples of cloze cards:

* The Holy Alliance was composed of {1:Russia}, {1:Prussia}, and {1:Austria}. #ankify 

* The quadruple alliance was composed of {1:Austria}, {1:Prussia}, {1: Russia}, and {1:Great Britain}. #ankify 

* The congress system worked pretty well for {1:avoiding Great Power war}, for about {1:100 years}. #ankify

* The nation of Belgium was created at {1:the Congress of Vienna}. #ankify

* In WWI, the British promised the Arabs {1:Independence} in return for {1:rebelling against the Turks}. #ankify

* In 1900, a girl who set out to earn money was {1:embarrassing her father} by implying {1:that he couldn't support her}. #ankify

* In 1900, women would never be present in a {1:bar} or {1:smoking train-car}. #ankify

* In an American city in 1900, {1:horses} were everywhere. #ankify

* In 1900, people went without {fresh fruit and vegetables} for most of the year. #ankify

Each flash card should have as few words as possible, while still capturing all of the important details about a fact or idea. Most questions, and most answers should have fewer than 10 words. 

Condense the sentences as much as possible while still getting the core idea across.

Make between 1 and 5 flashcards: as many as is necessary to capture all the important or interesting ideas and facts in the text.



Here is the text to make flashcards for:
